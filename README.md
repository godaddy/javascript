# godaddy-style

Official GoDaddy JavaScript styleguide. It includes `eslint` packages for three use-cases and can be used as a standard in any new project.

- [`eslint-config-godaddy`]: Base configuration for _non-React_, ES6 JavaScript applications
- [`eslint-config-godaddy-react`]: Configuration for ES6 React JavaScript applications
- [`eslint-config-godaddy-es5`]: Configuration for React _and_ non-React ES5 JavaScript applications.

There are many useful features:

- **Standard. No configuration.** – Stop worrying about style and focus on your work.
- **Modern** – Uses modern linting tools like `eslint`.
- **Auto-fix** – Auto-fix is enabled by-default through in `eslint`. Many rules will fix themselves!

This styleguide is used by dozens of product teams at GoDaddy. Have a question or comment? [Open an issue!](https://github.com/godaddy/javascript/issues/new)

## Installation

Depend on one of the provided packages. e.g. for `eslint-config-godaddy`
``` sh
# Default with ES6
npm i eslint-config-godaddy --save-dev

# OR (with React rules)
npm i eslint-config-godaddy-react --save-dev

# OR (legacy ES5)
npm i eslint-config-godaddy-es5 --save-dev
```

## Usage

There are two ways to use this styleguide depending on your own tooling preference: directly using pre-included binaries.

1. Use the pre-included binaries. These use _exactly_ the configuration defined in the individual `eslint-config-godaddy*` package **with auto-fix enabled automatically.**
``` js
{
  "scripts": "eslint-godaddy files/ you/ want-to/ lint/"
}
```
2. Define your local `.eslintrc` and run `eslint` yourself:
``` js
module.exports = {
  extends: 'godaddy'
  rules: {
    //
    // Put any rules you wish to override here.
    //
  }
}
```

The `--fix` option in `eslint` is [**only** available as a CLI option](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/issues/8041). Auto-fix will *NOT be enabled* unless you run `eslint --fix` in your `package.json`.

``` js
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint --fix files/ you/ want-to/ lint/"
  }
}
```


## Included dotfiles

This project includes dotfiles with comments under the `dotfiles` directory, but **you should use the distributable versions of these files under `dist`.**

### ESLint

The styleguide uses `eslint` for all correctness focused linting. All strictly style related checking (i.e. whitespace) is handled by `jscs`. Only the rules exclusive to `eslint` have been enabled or disabled accordingly to make sure there is no overlap with `jscs`.

## Additional Suggestions for Best Practices

This section is a place for additional best practices that may be useful but are not strictly enforced by this styleguide. Have something to add here? Great! [Submit a PR](#how-do-i-contribute).

### React

## FAQ

### How do I override a specific rule ?

1. Add a `.eslintrc` file at the root of your project:
``` js
{
  "extends": "godaddy",
  "rules": {
    // Disable the 'max-params' rule
    "max-params": 0
  }
}
```
2. Add a param to specify the path of your own `.eslintrc` file in your `package.json`:
``` js
{
  "scripts": {
    "eslint": "eslint-godaddy -c .eslintrc lib/ test/",
  }
}
```

### How do I contribute?

Fork this repository and submit a pull request.

Proposed modifications to the style guide should modify the files in `/dotfiles` before running `npm run build` when submitting a pull request. This repository utilizes the [fashion-show](https://github.com/indexzero/fashion-show) module to generate the `/dist` files to be checked in.

### I disagree with a specific rule

Great. We'd love to talk about it. Fork this repository and submit a pull-request.

### Help! It's not working for me!

## Roadmap

- Add more specific style guidance around React.
- Translate dotfile rules into more verbose written documentation.
- Add support for IDE formats (IntelliJ, Webstorm, Atom, Eclipse, Sublime, etc...)
- Never stop improving.
